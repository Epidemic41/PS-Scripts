ping bing with extra steps
#by David Lee
#made for when my isp is mad at me
#clears dns cache,  pings a target site, and displays the results
#if you use this, update lines ~41-49 to update the dumpfile


Clear-DnsClientCache #clear dns cache as a precaution

#if I forget this is running, this will prevent it from going on forever

#checks and or sets target

    New-Variable -Name "Target" -Value "Bing.com" 
    #Write-Host "target variable created"
        ##uncomment for debugging
}elseif ($Target -ne $null) {
        Write-Host "target site is"$Target -ForegroundColor Gray} 

#counts total pings
